**Differential Amplifier**

**Introduction**

<p> A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input voltages while rejecting any signals that are common to both inputs .For each differential amplifier we begin with qualitative analysis and Intuitive analysis . we assume perfect symmetry.</p><br>


**Aim**<br>
<p> Design differential amplifier for the following specifications </p><br>
<p>Vdon = 3.3v</p><br> <p>P<=3mw</p><br> <p>Vincm=1.72v</p><br> <p>Vocm=1.81v</p><br> <p>Vp=0.7v</p><br>
<p>perform DC analysis,Transient analysis and AC analysis and extract the required parameters</p><br>
