**1. Itroduction**
<p>
  In this experiment we do the Dc, Ac and Trancient analysis of the Common Source Amplifier. In this analysis we determine the DC biasing conditions , in Ac analysis we determine frequency response and in Transient analysis we determine gain and output.

**Components**
<p>
  This circuit consist of TSMC 180nm NMOS transistor (CMOSN) , drain resistor and voltage sources (V1 & V2) .
